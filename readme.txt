- Add assets on a per page/post basis. Even custom post types.
- Style the front end assets box to fit the site design
- Share relevant images, graphics and text on the pages specific to that content
- Note: This plugin is for linking to assets, not uploading assets. (Link to box.net, zip archive, etc)
