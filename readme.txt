== Description ==
Site Assets is a tool to easily share website assets on a per page basis. This is most helpful on site with multiple contributors and developers.

- Set permissions on who can add or view the assets
- Add assets on a per page/post basis. Even custom post types.
- Style the front end assets box to fit the site design or choose from predefined styles
- Share relevant images, graphics and text on the pages specific to that content
- Note: This plugin is for linking to assets, not uploading assets. (Link to box.net, zip archive, etc)


== Installation ==
